Data Processing

This section outlines how IATI data is processed by IATI Tables.

Flattening
============

Top-level elements
--------------------


There are two top-level tables in IATI Tables:

1. The :code:`activity` table is generated from `Activity <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/>`_ files, and contains rows of :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity` elements.
2. The :code:`organisation` table is generated from `Organisation <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/organisation-standard/>`_ files, and contains rows of :iati-reference:`iati-organisations/iati-organisation` elements.

All other tables are children of these top-level tables.
Tables prefixed with :code:`organisation_` contain child elements of the :iati-reference:`iati-organisations/iati-organisation` element, and can be joined back to the :code:`organisation` table using the column :code:`_link_organisation`.
The remaining tables contain child elements of the :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity` element, and can be joined back to the :code:`activity` table using the column :code:`_link_activity`.

..  ::
  **IATI Tables doesn't perform deduplication.** If an activity appears multiple times in published data, it will appear multiple times in IATI tables.

Singular child elements
------------------------

Child elements which can appear zero or one times become columns in the parent table.

For example, the :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity/iati-identifier` element becomes the column :code:`iati-identifier` in the :code:`activity` table.

Repeatable child elements
-----------------------------

Child elements which can appear more than once are unnested into a new table.

For example, the :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity/transaction` element becomes the table :code:`transaction`.

Narrative elements
---------------------

Elements which contain a :code:`narrative` element are flattened into a single string column in the parent table.

For example, given the following :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity/title` element:

.. code:: xml

    <title>
        <narrative>Activity title</narrative>
        <narrative xml:lang="fr">Titre de l'activité</narrative>
        <narrative xml:lang="es">Título de la actividad</narrative>
    </title>

This element will be transformed into the string: "Activity title, FR: Titre de l'activité, ES: Título de la actividad",
and stored in the column :code:`title_narrative` in the :code:`activity` table.

Common columns
========================

The following columns are present in all tables:

:code:`_link`
    The primary key for each table.
:code:`_link_activity` or :code:`_link_organisation`
    The foreign key to the :code:`activity` or :code:`organisation` table respectively.
:code:`dataset`
    The name of the dataset this row came from. This can be used to find the dataset in the IATI registry, using the URL: :code:`https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset/<DATASET_NAME>`.
:code:`prefix`
    The registry publisher ID this row came from. This can be used to find the dataset in the IATI registry, using the URL: :code:`https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/<PREFIX>`.

Codelists
============

Codelists are joined to the tables as part of the process.

For example, given the :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-status` element,
whose attribute :code:`@code` uses the `ActivityStatus <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/ActivityStatus/>`_ codelist:

.. code:: xml

    <activity-status code="2" />

This element will be transformed into two columns in the :code:`activity` table:

- The column :code:`activitystatus_code` with the value :code:`2`.
- The column :code:`activitystatus_codename` with the value :code:`Implementation`.

Currency Conversion
========================

IATI Tables converts the :iati-reference:`iati-activities/iati-activity/transaction/value` element to USD.

This is calculated by pulling the `Code for IATI IMF exchange rates dataset <https://github.com/codeforIATI/imf-exchangerates>`_,
and using the transaction's :code:`@value-date` attribute to determine the exchange rate to use.

The result is stored in the transaction (:code:`trans`) table in a new column :code:`value_usd`.

Transaction Splitting
========================

IATI Tables transforms the :code:`transaction` (trans) table to proportionally split the transaction values across multiple sectors or countries/regions.
The transformed transactions can be found in the :code:`transaction_breakdown` table. 

It follows the same methodology set out in the `CDFD documentation <https://docs.countrydata.iatistandard.org/en/latest/processing/#transaction-splitting>`_.
